# MemoBio2015
The code used in the ipython practical during the "Les Houches School" memobio2015 ( http://memobio2015.u-strasbg.fr/index.php ) 

contain :

#### Presentation.ipynb
A rapid presentation of the scientific python environment.
It presents :

 - **Python** The core language
 - **iPython** a handy interactive shell
 - **Notebook** a very handy graphic user interface running in the WEB browser
 - **numpy scipy** the numerical libraries
 - **matplotlib** the graphing library

Then some basic examples in function analysis or image analysis.

Finally some ideas about open-source, open-science, and the role of programming in modern science.

#### FTICR_1.ipynb
An example on how this set-up can be used to process a data-set.
Example is given here on a FT-ICR data-set.

#### Pract_CS.ipynb
This notebook contains a introcution to simple ideas which are important in Comressed Sensing approaches.

This goes though:
 - $\ell_2$ norm (classical cartesian norm) vs $\ell_1$ norm
 - the effect of minimizing the $\ell_1$ norm on simple problems
 - some properties of random matrices, in particular how they approximate an orthogonal transform

#### OMP_example.ipynb
A toy example using the *Orthogonal Maching Pursuit* method (from the scikit-learn library) to solve a Compressed Sensing subsampled measurement.
